<img src="edgypixels.png"style="width:500px;">

Given an image file, apply an **edge detection** filter or a **posterization** filter.
Uses the Pillow Python library.

**posterize(image file, threshold)**: reduce the brightness levels down to 2 values (black and white)
**detect_edge(image file, threshold)**: create sketchy outlines based on the contrast between pixels
